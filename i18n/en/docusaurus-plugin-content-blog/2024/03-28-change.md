In order to make better use of the limited storage space, we have made the following adjustments to the mirror station.

Since the new version of Raspberry Pi debian completely adopts the debian software source, we delete the following images:

- raspbian
- raspberrypi
- raspbian-addons

At the same time,the official source of debian already contains non-free software, We delete the following mirror images:

- debian-nonfree

In order to make better use of limited storage space, we make the following adjustments to the mirror site.

Since the new version of Raspberry Pi Debian completely uses the Debian software source, we delete the following mirrors.

- raspbian
- raspberrypi
- raspbian-addons

At the same time, the official Debian repository already contains non-free software. We delete the following mirrors.

- debian-nonfree

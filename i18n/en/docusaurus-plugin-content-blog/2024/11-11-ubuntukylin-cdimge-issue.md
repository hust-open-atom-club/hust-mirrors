authors: mudogliang

Due to the expiration of the domain name `cdimage.ubuntukylin.com`, the ubuntukylin-cdimage mirrors are unable to synchronize properly. As a result, our mirror site is suspending the synchronization of ubuntukylin-cdimage mirrors until the community provides a new synchronization address and method. Please download the latest version of the mirror files from the ubuntukylin community.

We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding and patience.

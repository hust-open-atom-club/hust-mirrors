From the original nginx autoindex to today's complete web service;from the initial internal use by more than a dozen people to today's public service;

From the initial four or five mirror synchronizations to today's dozens of mirror synchronizations;

From  the initial hundreds of GB of storage to today's dozens of TB of storage.

After a year of testing and improvement,our mirror station is finally officially open to public!:joy:

Now,our mirror station has finally become a  real "mirror station",providing more convenient services for the majority of Internet users.
You can access our mirror station anywhere in the world to download the software package,mirrors,source code warehouses,etc you need.

**At the same time,we have abandoned the old domain name mirrors.hust.college and only retained the service of mirrors.hust.edu.cn. Please update it.**

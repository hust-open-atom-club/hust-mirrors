title: Mirror Repository Update Notification  
authors: m0rtzz

To better meet user needs and optimize resource allocation, we have updated the synchronization policy for our mirror repository as follows:

1. **Resumed Synchronizations:**
   - Synchronization of all cgit repositories, including critical code repositories such as `linux.git`, has been fully restored.
   - OpenBSD mirror synchronization has been re-enabled, and resources for this project are once again available via our service.

2. **Refined Synchronization Scope:**
   - The synchronization strategy for the Anolis OS mirror has been optimized: going forward, only the **two most recent minor versions** within each major release will be synchronized.
   - In accordance with this policy, synchronization for Anolis OS versions **8.2, 8.4, 8.6, and 8.8** has been discontinued.

We remain committed to enhancing the stability and efficiency of our mirror service, striving to deliver a higher-quality user experience. Thank you for your continued support and understanding.

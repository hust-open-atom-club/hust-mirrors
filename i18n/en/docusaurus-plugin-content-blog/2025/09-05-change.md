authors: m0rtzz

Due to recent disk space shortages, our mirror repository experienced synchronization issues for a period of time. To resolve this problem and utilize our limited storage resources more efficiently, we have implemented the following adjustments:

1. Removed the following mirrors:  
   - OpenBSD  
   - ubuntukylin-cdimage  
2. Discontinued synchronization for Anolis OS version 23.1.

We remain committed to continuously optimizing the content of our mirror repository to ensure the availability of the most relevant and widely used distributions and resources. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by these changes and greatly appreciate your understanding and ongoing support.

To better meet user needs and optimize resource allocation, we have made the following adjustments to our mirror site's synchronization strategy.

1. Removed the following mirrors:
   - Anolis

2. Added synchronization:
   - Added synchronization for some github-releases, currently enabled for `rustdesk/rustdesk`, `ip7z/7zip`, and `llvm/llvm-project` projects
   - Added synchronization for radxa-deb

We will continue to monitor the stability of mirror services and resource usage efficiency to provide you with higher quality access experience. Thank you for your continued support and understanding.

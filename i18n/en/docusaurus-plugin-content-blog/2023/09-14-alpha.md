On September 13th, after more than three months of internal testing, the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) Open Source Mirror Site has officially launched for internal testing, available at the temporary URL (https://mirrors.hust.college).

The servers of the open source mirror site use Kunpeng 920 processors with 2*48 cores and 20TB of hard disk space. Currently, the mirror site has synchronized 27 mirror sources with a total data size of 13TB, providing three access methods: HTTP, HTTPS, and RSYNC.

# Open Source Code
We have now made the front-end and back-end code used by the mirror site publicly available under the Gitee organization (https://gitee.com/dzm91_hust/). We welcome everyone to star🌟!

- Front-end code: <https://gitee.com/dzm91_hust/hust-mirrors>
- Back-end code: <https://gitee.com/dzm91_hust/tunasync>
- Quick mirror change tool: <https://gitee.com/dzm91_hust/hustmirror-cli>

## Linux Mint Introduction and Software Management
Linux Mint is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. The purpose of Linux Mint is to provide a free and open-source, modern, elegant, powerful yet easy-to-use operating system. Linux Mint also uses `apt` as its package manager, similar to Ubuntu and Debian, and you need to edit the paths in `/etc/apt/sources.list` and `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*`.

## Ubuntu / Debian Software Source Replacement

For some sources from Ubuntu and Debian, you can refer to the [Ubuntu Help](./ubuntu) and [Debian Help](./debian) to make modifications.

## Linux Mint Software Source Replacement

:::caution
**To avoid errors after replacing the software source configuration files, please back up the system's original software source configuration files before proceeding with the following steps.**
:::

1. Modify `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/official-package-repositories.list`, replacing `packages.linuxmint.com` with the mirror source.

```deb varcode
[] (release) { victoria:21.2, vera:21.1, vanessa:21, una:20.3, uma:20.2, ulyssa:20.1 } Linux Mint versions
---
deb ${_http}://${_domain}/linuxmint ${release} main upstream import backport
```

2. Update the software with the following command.

```shell varcode
[ ] (root) Whether you are a root user
---
const SUDO = !root ? 'sudo ' : '';
---
${SUDO}apt update
```

:::caution
After completion, do not use mintsources (the built-in graphical software source setting tool) for any further operations, as mintsources will overwrite `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/official-package-repositories.list` after any operation, regardless of whether "OK" is pressed.
:::

## One-click Source Replacement

:::caution
This method is only applicable for changing from the official source to this site's source. If you have already changed the source, do not use the following commands.
:::

Use the `sed` command to directly replace the default source URL [http://packages.linuxmint.com](http://packages.linuxmint.com) in the software source configuration file with the current mirror source.

```shell varcode
[ ] (root) Whether you are a root user
---
const SUDO = !root ? 'sudo ' : '';
---
${SUDO}sed -i.bak 's|http://packages.linuxmint.com|${_http}://${_domain}/linuxmint|g' /etc/apt/official-package-repositories.list
${SUDO}sed -i 's|http://archive.ubuntu.com|${_http}://${_domain}|g' /etc/apt/official-package-repositories.list
```

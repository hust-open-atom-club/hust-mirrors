## GNU Introduction

GNU was initiated by Richard Stallman (rms) in 1983，aiming to build an operating system developed collectively by everyone so that all software users can freely control their computing.
GNU's fundamental and consistent goal is to provide a 100% free software operating system compatible with Unix. Not 95%, not 99.5%, but 100% free.
This system is called GNU，which is a recursive acronym for GNU's Not Unix — a way to pay homage to Unix's technical philosophy while showing that GNU is different.

Technically speaking, GNU is very similar to Unix. But unlike Unix, GNU gives its users freedom.
